  <h2 class="heading first">Where to Begin</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">The Guest House is a theatrical exploration of what it means to heal oneself. The performance itself is free of dialogue and instead relies on abstracted masks, kinetic costumes, interpretive dance and movement, projections and props, and music—colorfully and demonstratively inspiring audiences to treat their whole being like a guest house—welcoming each thought or emotion, good or bad, for intentional engagement and healing rather than avoidance and destruction. As Rumi says, “For each has been sent as a guide from beyond.”</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Inspired by the Rumi poem of the same name, this is an internationally touring, collective mental health exercise and healing ritual presented as a group performance art piece and workshop series.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Accompanied by a musical score, six “guests”—each representing a unique emotional phenomenon or state of being—are individually welcomed and tended to by our hero, The Hearth Keeper. Each performer, uniquely costumed and masked, projects our familiar shared joys and struggles onstage, eventually arriving at a personal ritual which helps them welcome, understand and lovingly hold themselves, wounds and all.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">We hope to inspire our audiences to fully engage with the process of self-healing personal and intergenerational trauma. A difficult but necessary process, we reveal it to be brave, powerful and accessible work and remind them that they’re not alone.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">This show is also an homage to the too often neglected work of motherhood—work which must be cherished and supported at the global, national and personal level if there is to be any righting of the many wrongs in our world.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">During each run of performances, we will also conduct workshops for the public featuring poetry writing, meditation, self-puppet making and musical movement and breathing exercises.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">Our Inspirations, Process, and History</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">Diane diPrima’s Revolutionary Letters, the universality of the Hero’s Journey, Patti Smith’s continuing artistic evolution, the striking visuals of Robert Wilson, the simplicity and boldness of Marina Abramovic, Frida Kahlo’s post-accident practice, the wisdom of Thich Nhat Hanh, dancing with oneself alone in your room.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Like so many, we’re answering a call for catharsis. From 2003-2008 we were the Stars and Garters Theatre Company—people’s theatre of the “grind your bones to bake your bread” variety (SF Weekly). We split ways—our composer gained a degree in cognitive science and became a Buddhist chaplain; one cofounder became a mother of three, a celebrated painter/poet and had a large brain tumor removed; another cofounder helped galvanize communities through assisted storytelling and launch an innovative village project in India; our lead fabricator founded an arts education organization. This reunion weaves this newfound cumulative experience into our most intricate and robust production to date.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Our work is emotionally multifaceted—life and death held in the same breath, an unexpected approach, the humor brought up and spotlighted, the joys and struggles shared.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Our lineage is that of the People’s Theatre movement as we are big on community engagement—productions which are down to earth, useful, entertaining and accessible, speaking to what is happening in this moment all around us, giving you the tools you need right now to move forward and thrive.</p>
